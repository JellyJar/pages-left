# pages-left
Python script to calculate the pace for readers' pacing with their books, by calculating pages left, percentage done, and how much pages per day are required to have a book finished by a given deadline.

-----

Goals & Desired Improvements:

* Percentage
-Add option to round to nearest hundredth rather than whole integer (i.e. 49.57% instead of 50%)

* Importing
- Options to import dates and use dates rather than a fixed amount of dates.
- Options to import time

* Save deadlines for future use
 
* Create master script
- Option to import other pagesleft.py scripts
- Option to create separate pageleft.py scripts from master script
  - Book title, total pages, desired deadline

* Create basic GUI interface, easy to use for non-programmers, etc.
